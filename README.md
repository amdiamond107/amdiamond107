### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for sports, and an extensive background in digital marketing, product development and sales. 

I graduated from Syracuse University with a B.S. in Sport Management, along with a minor study in Entrepreneurship & Emerging Enterprises, and have since gained valuable work experience across a variety of companies within the sports industry, such as Octagon Worldwide, FOX Sports (HTS), MLB Advanced Media, The Topps Company, FanDuel, and SiriusXM.

Over the last year, I've decided to pivot my career focus from marketing to software development, and I began by enrolling in, and graduating from, Flatiron School earlier in 2023. I am now equipped with a multitude of frontend and backend web development skills, specifically within JavaScript, React.js, Python, & Flask. programming environments.

I've developed a few of my own apps already, which are readily accessible within the portfolio section my [personal website](https://andrew-diamond.com/), and, I am currently serving as a COO/VP of Engineering for an early stage mobile app startup venture.

When I'm not coding, or studying best frontend and/or backend web development practices, you can likely find me on a softball field with friends, a pickleball court with my wife, on a hike in the remote wilderness, or advising friends about which players to target in their upcoming fantasy football draft. You might also find me rooting on my favorite sports teams, the New York Mets, Knicks and Giants, but as of late, you'd likelier find me commiserating over their latest collective demonstrations of futility.

I'll wrap this up with two fitting quotes, as it relates to the way I approach my life and career...

     1. "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." - Wayne Gretzsky

     2. "Take your job seriously, but don't take yourself too seriously." - Alex Trebek
